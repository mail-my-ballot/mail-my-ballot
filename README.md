## Getting Started

### Manual Dependencies
Almost all dependnecies are listed in devDependencies.  However, still depends on
- Install yarn (< 1) globally (`npm i -g yarn`)
- Install now globally (`npm i -g now`).
- To deploy the server using Google Cloud, follow the steps in `https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/nodejs/quickstart`.

### Installation
In the root directory, run `yarn install`.

### Starting the dev server
To start the client and backend dev servers, run
```bash
yarn server gulp start // server on localhost:8080
yarn client gulp start // client on localhost:3000
```

These commands will likely fail until you have setup the configuration correctly (see below).

### Configuration
Running the app requires some configuration setting.  All of those are exported in `env/env.js`.  It has two dependencies that are not checked into source control:

#### Dev Overrides
`env.dev.nogit.js`: will generally work out of the box.  To run the backend services, you will want to override the existing configuration.
#### Application Secrets
`secrets.nogit.json`: The secrets can be made empty strings (they must be defined for the server to work).  You can set them as you need to

## Configuration Details
Below are the settings that need to be set to get an environment to work:

#### Mailgun
You only need these to send emails (last step in signup flow).  It's easy to get set up for free.

#### Twilio
You only need these to send faxes (last step in signup flow).  It's easy to get set up for free.

#### Incoming fax numbers
To test Twilio, we setup an incoming fax number.  ([FaxBurner](https://www.faxburner.com/)) offers a free temporary one.  Set `RECEIVE_FAX_NUMBER` to this number.

#### Dev Firestore Access
Goto the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/project/mmb-dev-cee81/settings/serviceaccounts/adminsdk) and generate a new key and place it in `packages/server/secrets/[...].json`.
Then make sure `env.js` has `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` set to `./secrets/[...].json` (override using `developmentRaw`).

#### Google OAuth (development of organizer-facing pages only)
Following the instructions [here](http://www.passportjs.org/docs/google/):

1. Enable [Google+ API from the Console](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/plus.googleapis.com/overview?project=mmb-staging)
2. Once you have done the above, you should be able to turn on the [OAuth Conset screen](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials/consent?project=mmb-staging)
3. Once you have done the above, you should be able to create [OAuth Credentials](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials?project=mmb-staging)

Download and save these credentials for dev, prod, and staging.  Thes eare the `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` fields.

#### Google Maps API
You will have to enable Google Maps geolocation and set `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` in order to do the ZIP code to state and address to election official lookups.  Instructions [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/get-api-key).

#### Express session secrets
Set `SESSION_SECRET` to a random string of your choice to encrypt sessions.

## Repo Structure
The code is a lerna repo split into three packages:
- `packages/client`
- `packages/server`
- `packages/common` shared code symlinked between above to

Each package has it's own `gulpfile.js`.

### Runnign tasks
To invoke the grunt file, run commands like
```bash
yarn server gulp script --env developement --file src/script/fetchData.ts
```

Check out the gulpfiles for more information.

### Checking repo
To check if the repo is working run the following four commands
```bash
yarn bootstrap && yarn build && yarn lint && yarn test
```

## Adding a State
To add a new state, you will need to complete the following steps:
1. Increment version number and publish a new version of the [elections official data](https://github.com/mail-my-ballot/elections-officials).
1. Match the version number in the environment variable `ELECTIONS_OFFICIALS_VERSION`
1. Add the state to `availableStates` and `implementedStates` const arrays in `common`.  This should start generating type errors from incomplete switch statements when you run
    ```bash
    yarn build
    ```
    Fixing those errors by pattern matching should get you a new state.  Becareful to follow the state-by-state regulations for VBM signup.  For reference, here are the core commits adding [Arizona](https://github.com/mail-my-ballot/mail-my-ballot/commit/arizona) and [New York](https://github.com/mail-my-ballot/mail-my-ballot/commit/new_york).

## Hosting
The best way to showcase changes to your site is to host your own staging instance.  Each instance has its own configuration (e.g. `production` or `staging`) and can be edited via the gulpfile via `--env production`.  To add your own, copy and modify the contents the `staging` object in `env/env.js` using your own namespace (e.g. your GithubID).

### Now (Client Hosting)
The client is hosted by [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), which is also called Zeit and Now.  If you create and deploy to your own zeit hosting instance and point it to the dev or staging backend instance, you should be able to experiment / show off your own front-end.

### App Engine (Server Hosting)
To get started, goto [AppEngine Getting Started](https://console.cloud.google.com/appengine/start?project=mmb-staging&folder&organizationId) and follow the prompts.

Don't forget to enable the indexes (see the gulp file server's `gulpfile.js`).  To do this, run the command resulting from `yarn server gulp deploy-index --env [your environment]`.

### Secrets in Server Production
Configuration and secrets are currently added into `app.yaml` (not in git) from `app.tmpl.yaml` via gulp process (stored in git).

Alternative (not used): follow this [SO answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/54055525/8930600), put all secrets in a special file that is not stored in source control.
